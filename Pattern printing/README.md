# Pattern Printing

  - Any thing that is printed in console starts from top left and flows to bottom right is a <B> Pattern </B>.
  - It will fill top row first until a new line is encountered or row is completely filled, 
  then it will proceed with next row and continue in that fashion.
  - Any thing to be printed has to be printed using combination of a designated character (say ‘*’), space and new line.
  Then there has to be at least two loops like <B> For Loops, While Loops </B>.
  - There has to be one outer loop which will completely span through one row of screen, 
  and there have to be at least one one or multiple inner loops which will print character or space as per our 
  requirement in increasing or decreasing progression or constant some times.

 ## NOTE
   - Packages and version are installed without effecting the system or other projects. 
   - PyCharm has a built-in interface to create a virtualenv and install packages. 
   - Or you can create it from the command line and then point PyCharm at it.
   
   ## How to install packages in PyCharm?
     
     Go into File → Settings → Project Settings → Project Interpreter.
     
     Then press configure interpreter, and navigate to the "Paths" tab.
